# How to Contribute
First of all, thank you wanting to help out! Here are some of the main things you can help with:

## Code Inspection
At the time of writing, I'm not super experienced with app development on Android, so I followed a tutorial to guide me along the process of making this app, while making some changes along the way. In that case, some of the resources used then might be outdated now, or there might be a better method than that tutorial showed that I might not have thought of. Any sort of code touch-ups would be greatly appreciated.

## Bug Hunting
If you spot an issue that talks about a bug in the app, then you could go and have a sniff at the code and see if you can find the problem and a possible fix via a MR. If you can't code, then helping the user run a logcat, or gather more useful logs and info can help other contributers find a fix.

## MR Inspections
While I do my best to review MRs before accepting them, it would be great to get a couple of other sets of eyes checking the requested changes for any errors or malicious intentions. That way, we can keep the app safe for all users.

They are the main things, but I'm all ears when it comes to suggestions!
