If you didn't know already, Nitter is a free, open-source frontend for Twitter maintained by Zedeus on GitHub. All praise to the Nitter service goes to them.
Thanks to Android WebView, you can have a completely separate app for Nitter and isolate your cookies and history from your main browser app, which is a privacy bonus.

Full details about this client can be found in the projects' README file on GitLab.
